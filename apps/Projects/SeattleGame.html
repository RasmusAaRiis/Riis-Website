<p>Project Gloop is a first-person rouge-like game that some classmates and I created while on a school trip to Seattle. We lived with host families and spent our time working on our projects at the local community college. </p>

<p>My role in the development was programmer. Specifically, I worked on the player controller, the combat system, and the upgrades system. The game was created using the Unity game-engine and programmed in C#. Since we were a group of seven people, including programmers, artists, and composers, we utilized Git to collaborate.</p>

<p>The game takes place in a procedurally generated office, where the player must defeat chairs and cabinets possessed by evil gloop. The game is heavily physics based, meaning the player can use every object in the office as a weapon. Money lays scattered around the office, which the player can use to purchase upgrades at the end of every level, however the levels get increasingly harder. </p>
