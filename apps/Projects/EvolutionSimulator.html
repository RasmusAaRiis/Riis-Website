<p>This simulation was created as part of a school assignment, for which we received the top grade. A classmate and I were tasked and collaborated on making an art-product that visualizes evolution in an entertaining and understandable way.</p>
<p>Under the development I worked on implementing the animals’ behaviors, such as how they pick a partner, as well as tools to understand how the animals evolved over time. Since this simulation contains a large number of objects, I also spent a lot of time working on optimizing the program.</p>

<p>The program contains two types of animals; the prey, visualized by ducks, and the predators, visualized by wolves. The wolves hunt the ducks, and the ducks eat strawberries. When two animals breed, their genes mix, which creates a survival-of-the-fittest dynamic. The user has the ability to inspect each animals’ genes/stats/data.</p>
