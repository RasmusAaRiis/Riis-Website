<p>Hey! My name is Rasmus, and this website is a hub of different projects I’ve been working on over time.</p>
<p>I’ve been coding from a very young age, making anything from small video games at the age of 10 to creating an interactive artificial reality sandbox for a high school assignment. These days most of my work on projects is built on C#, though I’ve worked with a variety of languages and hardware.</p>
<p>Apart from programming, I’m also very absorbed by the world of music. I play guitar and piano, but I also have an ever-growing vinyl collection that I started back in 2021. I’ve also always liked working with all kinds of media, be it various YouTube videos with my friends in 3rd grade or bringing some kind of camera on every trip I take, though I find I enjoy the editing more than the actual capturing.</p>
