<p>This is a video a friend and I created as part of a school assignment, where we had to showcase a controller and game we created. The game is a remake of the classic game Frogger. When it came to the controller, we were pretty much free to make whatever we wanted. Using an Arduino, we created a controller that required the user to touch water to control the frog. The theory was that this would create an immersive frog-like experience üê∏.</p>
<p>As for the video, we were just given orders to showcase the controller and game however we wanted. Thus, we created this extremely silly informercial/ad.</p>
